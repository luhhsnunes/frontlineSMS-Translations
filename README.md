frontlineSMS-Translations
=========================

Translation files for FrontlineSMS v2 for people to collaborate on.

Use Notepad++ on Windows, or TextEdit/Sublime/etc on Mac for editing the files. Or use any editor that can save files in "Unicode/UTF-8". 

You can use Google Transliterate to help transliterate from English to your language (or use the Google Transliterate/Translate chrome browser plugin).


Here is an example file that has been already translated. Note than only string on the RIGHT SIDE of the "=" are translated.
